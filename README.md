- The File Browser will be become better since i'll work on it on OhmFlux Engine. 
- As an goodie it also includes a sfx generator ;)
- The OPLController was part of my OhmFlux Engine. But I'am working on the new version with OPL3 Support.

# FMTPU for Turbo Pascal 6

by T. Hühn 1994

In the Folder ./pascal is  my source code of the FMTPU. I also added the DOS EXE which can be used with DosBox.

There are not all files to build in includes folder, since i don't know which Licences they are under. 

The includes/FMTPU.PAS file only uses DOS so not problem to use it ;)

The old instruments and some songs can be also be found in ./pascal/ADLIB

# FMTPU for Turbo Pascal 6

by T. Hühn 1994

This is my source code of the FMTPU. I also include the DOS EXE files which can be used with DosBox.

There are not all files to build in includes folder, since i don't know which Licences they are under. 

The includes/FMTPU.PAS file only uses DOS so not problem to use it ;)
